## Lesson 6: JavaScript Functions and Events

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Create and use functions
- Respond to user interactions with events
- Build interactive features

### 📖 Topics Covered
- Functions: declaration, parameters, return values
- Event listeners: `addEventListener()`
- Common events: `click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `keypress`
- Arrow functions (modern syntax)
- Changing CSS with JavaScript: `.style` property
- Adding/removing classes: `.classList.add()`, `.classList.remove()`, `.classList.toggle()`

### 🛠️ Hands-On Project
Create an interactive color changer where users can click buttons to change the background color of the page.

### 💡 Key Takeaway

> Functions and events are the foundation of interactive web applications.

---

## Lesson 7: JavaScript Control Flow and DOM Manipulation
